  TCNTx - Timer/Counter Register. The actual timer value is stored here.
  OCRx - Output Compare Register
  ICRx - Input Capture Register (only for 16bit timer)
  TIMSKx - Timer/Counter Interrupt Mask Register. To enable/disable timer interrupts.
  TIFRx - Timer/Counter Interrupt Flag Register. Indicates a pending timer interrupt.

  Now with we can use these new 16 ISR-based timers, while consuming only 1 hwarware Timer.
  Their independently-selected, maximum interval is practically unlimited (limited only by unsigned long miliseconds)
  The accuracy is nearly perfect compared to software timers. The most important feature is they're ISR-based timers
  Therefore, their executions are not blocked by bad-behaving functions / tasks.
  This important feature is absolutely necessary for mission-critical tasks.
