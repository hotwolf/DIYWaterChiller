title:  2nd Iteration
---

I've built a second iteration of my Peltier water cooler. This time it's a more modular approach with a radiator and fans right on the board.

My third set of cooling blocks is still on it's way and one of the four Peltier elemnts turns out to be broken. So with thee working TEC1-12706 elements
I'm able to cool the water flow down by about 0.5 &#8451;.

So now I've moved the old radiators into the primary cooling circuit, inbetween the outlet of the laser tube and the water tank.

This setup does not leak any water, but it does somehow leak quite a bit of air into the system. Luckily my water pump is strong enough to push out the air
within a few seconds.
