title:  Experimental Cooler
---

My Peltier elements have arrived in the mail, so I rigged up an experimental cooler setup without any current regulation. I'm using four 40x80mm aluminium water coolers and four TEC1-12706 peltier elements. Two aluminium blocks are now part of the primary cooling circuit and are sandwiched by the two aluminium blocks of the secondary circuit.

The secondary cooling circuit runs through some radiators, which are atteched to my exhaust fan.

This contraption works to some extend. I defenitely don't have to worry about regulating the current that runs through the peltier elements. The cooling effect is better than nothing, but the usability of this installation needs improvement.
